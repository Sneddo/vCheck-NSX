#PowerNSX Test template.
#Nick Bradford : nbradford@vmware.com

#Because PowerNSX is an API consumption tool, its test framework is limited to
#exercising cmdlet functionality against a functional NSX and vSphere API
#If you disagree with this approach - feel free to start writing mocks for all
#potential API reponses... :)

#In the meantime, the test format is not as elegant as normal TDD, but Ive made some effort to get close to this.
#Each functional area in NSX should have a separate test file.

#Try to group related tests in contexts.  Especially ones that rely on configuration done in previous tests
#Try to make tests as standalone as possible, but generally round trips to the API are expensive, so bear in mind
#the time spent recreating configuration created in previous tests just for the sake of keeping test isolation.

#Try to put all non test related setup and tear down in the BeforeAll and AfterAll sections.  ]
#If a failure in here occurs, the Describe block is not executed.
