Vester is a community project that aims to provide an extremely light-weight approach to vSphere configuration management using Pester and PowerCLI. The end-state configuration for each vSphere component, such as clusters and hosts, are abstracted into a simple config file. The configuration is tested and optionally remediated when drift is identified. The entire project is written in PowerShell. The code is open source, and `available on GitHub`_.
